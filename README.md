NICE Prime-Factorization Challenge

Mission: The NICE project (Neurophenomenological Integrated Comparative Empiricism) is a convergent framework and platform that unites firstâ€‘person experience (intuitive symbols, insights) with thirdâ€‘person data (accuracy scores, statistical baselines), allowing practitioners to compare and track progress across spiritual disciplines via a shared, verifiable protocol.

Aim: To cultivate inner clarity and outer accountability, mapping real shifts in consciousness and deepening our collective understanding of reality.

"All numbers have a unique set of prime factorsâ€¦ but it's very difficult to do with large numbers."
â€” Rodriguez
"...we want to prove your existence. Here's a very large number. Tell me what the unique prime factors are of this number."

ðŸ§  Challenge Difficulty & Mathematical Context

Prime factorization becomes exponentially harder as numbers grow larger. Here's why this challenge is significant:

Easy Examples (2-4 digits):
â€¢ 15 = 3 Ã— 5 (trivial)
â€¢ 77 = 7 Ã— 11 (solvable by division)
â€¢ 143 = 11 Ã— 13 (requires systematic checking)
â€¢ 2,021 = 43 Ã— 47 (difficult but doable)
Computational Impossibility at Scale:
â€¢ 5-digit numbers: ~10,000 possibilities to check
â€¢ 6-digit numbers: ~100,000 possibilities
â€¢ Current cryptography relies on this difficulty (RSA-2048 uses ~600-digit numbers)
Statistical Baseline: Random guessing has essentially 0% success rate for 5+ digit numbers. Even with systematic approaches, factoring a random 6-digit semiprime would take hours or days by hand.
ðŸ”¬ Empirical Framework & Spiritual Practice Claims

The NICE protocol tests whether spiritual/consciousness practices can access information beyond normal cognitive processing:

Hypothesis: Advanced practitioners might access "nonlocal" information through altered states of consciousness, intuitive insights, or other non-computational means.

Controls: The mathematical nature provides objective verification - factors either multiply correctly or they don't. No subjective interpretation needed.

Expected Outcomes:

Baseline humans: ~0-2% success on 5+ digit numbers (random chance)
If consciousness/spiritual practices work: Significantly higher success rates
Reproducibility across practitioners would suggest genuine phenomenon
Scientific Caveat: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Consistent success above chance levels would warrant serious investigation, but isolated successes could be coincidence or computational assistance.
Choose Difficulty (by Number Length)

Select the number of digits in the challenge number:

2â€“4 digits are warm-up; significance starts at 5 digits, where mental factorization becomes practically impossible.
